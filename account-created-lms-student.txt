Hi {{userName}},

Welcome to Codio!


Accessing Codio through an LMS/LTI (Canvas, Blackboard, Moodle etc.) system

If you registered through your school's LMS/LTI system, starting any new units in your course must be done through the LMS/LTI system.
Once you have opened a unit through your LMS/LTI you can then log into Codio directly to continue working if you prefer. 


Accessing Codio directly
    
If you initially accessed Codio through an LMS/LTI system, you will use the same email address for your Codio login and you will need to create a Codio account password. To create a new password, access Codio via your LMS/LTI and go to your Account page or use the Lost Password process. See https://docs.codio.com/students/#forgotten-passwords for more information.

When you have created an account password you can then login to Codio directly here {{codioUrl}}/p/login and login with your email address and the password you created.

For course specific questions speak to your instructor. If you have a Codio technical issue you can access product support from the dashboard, or the Help > Support menu when in an assignment, or you can email help@codio.com.


Regards,

Codio
