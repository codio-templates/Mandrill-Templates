Hi {{userName}}

We just wanted to let you know that '{{ownerName}}' has just removed you as a member of the '{{orgName}}' Organization on Codio.

If you do not have an individual account, you will not be able to access any projects. To regain access to your projects, you can create a new individual subscription at {{codioClientUrl}}/home/settings/?tab=billing.

Just hit reply if you need any help. 


Regards,

Codio
