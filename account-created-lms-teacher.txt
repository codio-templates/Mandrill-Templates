Hi {{userName}},

Welcome to Codio!

Accessing Codio directly
    
If you initially accessed Codio through an LMS/LTI system, you will use the same email address for your Codio login and you will need to create a Codio account password. To create a new password, access Codio via your LMS/LTI and go to your Account page or use the Lost Password process. See https://docs.codio.com/dashboard/account/#forgot-your-password.

When you have created an account password you can then login to Codio directly here {{codioUrl}}/p/login and login with your email address and the password you created.

    
To login to your Codio account, go to {{codioUrl}}/p/login and login with your email address and the password created when you signed up.
