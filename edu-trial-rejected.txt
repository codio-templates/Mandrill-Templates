Hello,

Unfortunately, we are unable to approve your request for a free Codio Instructor Account.

We would be happy to review this decision if you are able to provide some evidence that you are an educator in a school, university, non-profit or vocational institution.
  
Suitable evidence could be a link to your entry in your institution's online directory, proof of your name and job title, LinkedIn profile, reference, or any scanned documentation.

If you are a student attempting to join an existing course, contact your teacher for the Course Invite URL. See https://docs.codio.com/accessing-codio.html for more information.

If you are trying to join as a teacher, please contact the Administrator of the organisation and they can invite you into the organisation. See https://docs.codio.com/instructors/admin/organization/add-teachers.html#add-teachers-org for more information.

Kind regards, 

Codio
