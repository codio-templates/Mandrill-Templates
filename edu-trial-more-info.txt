Hello,

Unfortunately, we are unable to approve your request for an Educational Trial

We would be happy to review this decision if you are able to provide some evidence that you are an educator in a school, university, non-profit or vocational institution.
  
Suitable evidence could be a link to your entry in your institution's online directory, proof of your name and job title, LinkedIn profile, reference, or any scanned documentation.

If you are a student attempting to join an existing class, contact your teacher for the Class Invite URL. See https://docs.codio.com/students/#joining-a-course for more information.

If you are trying to join as a teacher, please contact the Administrator of the organisation and they can invite you into the organisation. See https://docs.codio.com/dashboard/organisations/#add-teachers for more information.

Kind regards, 

Codio
